# Introduction to Agents

Welcome to **Agents 101**—your fast‑track primer on what an *AI agent* is and why it matters.

## What is an AI agent?

Think of ChatGPT as a really smart conversational calculator.  An **agent** adds three super‑powers on top:

1. **Autonomy** – it can decide *how* to solve a request, not just *what* to say next.
2. **Tools** – it can reach for search engines, code interpreters, or your school calendar.
3. **Memory / State** – it keeps track of earlier steps and can loop until the goal is reached.

> **One‑liner:** *An agent = LLM brain + toolkit + short‑term memory.*

## Quick example (no code)

Prompt ChatGPT with:

> *"You are a talent‑show planner.  First list what you need, then ask follow‑up questions until you have everything."*

ChatGPT will run a mini‑plan‑execute loop—already acting like a baby agent.

## Why should you care?

* **Efficiency.** Automate chores (e.g., summarise five webpages for homework).
* **Creativity.** Combine tools (image gen + translator) for new project ideas.
* **Career‑ready skills.** Agents are how many real products embed LLMs today.
