        <question>"Summarize Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings report in plain language."</question>
        <answer>
        *Think of Tesla’s latest quarter as a marathon where the runner
        sprinted the middle miles but slowed slightly at the finish.*  
        • **Revenue** hit **$29.2 B**, up **31 % YoY**, driven by record Model Y deliveries.  
        • **Automotive gross margin** slipped to **23.4 %** (from 25.9 %) as price cuts and higher battery-material costs bit into profits.  
        • **GAAP EPS** came in at **$0.85** versus **$0.66** a year earlier.  
        • Management reaffirmed full-year delivery guidance and highlighted progress on the 4680 battery ramp-up.

        <question>"Explain how 2024 rate hikes affected JPMorgan Chase’s net-interest income (NII)."</question>
        <answer>
        Imagine NII as the **spread on a sandwich**—the thicker the filling
        (rate spread), the tastier the bite for the bank.  
        • **Fed funds rate** climbed from **4.5 % to 5.5 %** in 2024, widening the gap between what JPM paid on deposits and earned on loans.  
        • As a result, **NII rose 18 %** to **$96 B**, even though deposit growth was modest ( +2 %).  
        • Management noted that every 25 bp parallel shift in rates adds roughly **$2.8 B** to annual NII.  
        • Headwinds: higher deposit-beta and competition for high-yield CDs may cap further upside.
